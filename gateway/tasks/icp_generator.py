"""
ICP Set Generation Task

Generates new ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) sets for benchmark evaluation.
Runs daily at 12:00 AM UTC (midnight UTC).

CRITICAL DESIGN:
1. ICPs are generated RANDOMLY but held CONSTANT until next reset
2. ICPs are stored PRIVATELY in qualification_private_icp_sets
3. Miners NEVER see the ICPs until evaluation time
4. ICP hash is logged to transparency_log for verifiability

GENERATION PROCESS:
1. Generate 100 ICPs distributed across industries
2. Use LLM to create realistic, varied prompts
3. Compute ICP set hash
4. Store in database
5. Log to transparency_log
6. Activate the new set

CRITICAL: These must sound like REAL HUMANS typing, NOT templates. Imagine a salesperson quickly typing what they need.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. NEVER start with "Who should we target" or "Who should we find for you" - these are robotic
2. NEVER use the same sentence pattern more than 5 times across all 100 prompts
3. Each prompt should feel like a different person typed it

MANDATORY FIRST-PERSON VOICE (distribute evenly, ~20 each category):

CATEGORY A - Direct requests (first person):
- "I need VP of Sales contacts at SaaS companies, Series B, hiring SDRs right now"
- "I'm looking for CFOs at biotech startups that just closed funding rounds"
- "I want to reach out to CIOs at healthcare systems in Texas"

CATEGORY B - Casual/conversational:
- "yo can you pull some CTOs at fintech startups in NYC"
- "hey need some sales leaders at ecommerce companies, west coast"
- "gonna need a list of marketing VPs at B2B software companies"

CATEGORY C - Shorthand/telegraphic (no full sentences):
- "VP eng series B saas california hiring"
- "CFO biotech boston recently funded"
- "CTO devtools startups 50-200 employees"

CATEGORY D - Question format (genuine questions):
- "who handles procurement at manufacturing companies in Ohio?"
- "what's the best title to target for selling HR software?"
- "anyone know who buys cybersecurity at mid-market companies?"

CATEGORY E - Descriptive/specific requests:
- "Looking for VP of Engineering at cloud computing companies with 200-500 employees in the US, ideally they've posted about hiring challenges on LinkedIn"
- "Searching for Chief Medical Officers at digital health startups that raised Series A in the last 6 months"

REAL HUMAN EXAMPLES TO EMULATE:
- "I need to find heads of IT at hospitals in California. They should be actively evaluating new EHR systems."
- "can you get me a list of VPs of Sales at SaaS companies? series B or later, 100-500 employees, US based"
- "looking for fintech CFOs, specifically at payments companies, ideally ones that just raised"
- "VP Supply Chain at manufacturing - midwest region, companies doing digital transformation"
- "CISO or VP Security contacts at companies 1000+ employees. financial services preferred"
- "startup CTOs in the AI/ML space, seed to series A, SF bay area"
- "i need procurement heads at large retailers, the ones who buy supply chain software"
- "sales ops leaders at b2b saas - director level or above, companies using salesforce"

THINGS THAT MAKE PROMPTS FEEL FAKE (AVOID):
- "Who should we target for our X?" - TOO ROBOTIC
- "Who should we find for you?" - TOO ROBOTIC  
- "Find decision makers in X sector" - TOO TEMPLATED
- "Ideal buyer: X at Y companies" - TOO STRUCTURED
- Starting every prompt the same way
- Always using the exact same structure

VARIATION TECHNIQUES:
- Some prompts are 1 line, others are 2-3 sentences
- Some mention specific products, others don't
- Some have typos: "eng" "cos" "ppl" "b2b" "saas"
- Some are very specific, others are vague
- Mix formal ("I am seeking") with casual ("yo need")

Your output must be valid JSON."""
