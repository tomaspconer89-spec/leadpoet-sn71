Weighted Consensus Utilities

Implements V-score weighted consensus for lead validation outcomes.

The consensus mechanism aggregates validator decisions using their V-scores
(validator scores from Bittensor) as weights. This ensures that validators
with higher stake/reputation have more influence on the final outcome.

    Compute v_trust × stake weighted consensus for lead outcome.
    
    Aggregates all validator decisions for a lead using (v_trust × stake) as weights.
    Only includes validators who validated THIS specific lead.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Query all revealed validations for this lead (decision, rep_score, rejection_reason, v_trust, stake)
    2. Calculate weight for each validator: v_trust × stake
    3. Compute weighted rep_score (Σ rep_score × weight / Σ weight)
    4. Compute weighted approval (Σ weight for "approve" / Σ weight)
    5. Final decision: "approve" if approval_ratio > 50%, else "deny"
    6. Calculate primary_rejection_reason (most common among denials)
    
    Args:
        lead_id: Lead UUID
        epoch_id: Epoch number
        evidence_data: Optional pre-fetched evidence data for this lead (list of dicts).
