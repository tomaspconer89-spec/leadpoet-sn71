"""
Qualification System: Lead Database Verification

Verifies that leads returned by qualification models match the actual data
in the leads table. This prevents gaming where models modify
fields (employee_count, role, industry, etc.) to better match the ICP.

Design:
- lead_id (the `id` column in the leads table) is REQUIRED on every lead
- ONE batch query at the start of scoring (low latency)
- Local dict lookups per lead (O(1) per lead)

IMPORTANT: This verification time is NOT counted against the model's
execution time. It runs during the validator's scoring phase.
